 * change those to your connection information
 * 
 * This class also has static string variables for pickup, delivery and dine-in. If your database
 * stores the strings differently (i.e "pick-up" vs "pickup") changing these static variables will
 * ensure that the comparison is checking for the right string in other places in the program. You
 * will also need to use these strings if you store this as boolean fields or an integer.
